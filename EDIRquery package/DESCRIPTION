Description: EDIRquery provides a tool to search for genes of interest within the Exome Database of Interspersed Repeats (EDIR). A gene name is a required input, and users can additionally specify repeat sequence lengths, minimum and maximum distance between sequences, and whether to allow a 1-bp mismatch. Outputs include a summary of results by repeat length, as well as a dataframe of query results. Example data provided includes a subset of the data for the gene GAA (ENSG00000171298). To query the full database requires providing a path to the downloaded database files as a parameter.
